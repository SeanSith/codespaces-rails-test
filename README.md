# Codespaces Rails Test

This is a repo of a basic Rails 7 app with TailwindCSS and MariaDB (MySQL) as a database. This was designed to be a POC
based on [another repository](https://github.com/SeanSith/rails-with-vscode-remote-containers) with everything a bit more
built-out so that it would start up and run straight from starting up Codespaces.

## Setup

Open this repository in a Codespace. It should Just Workâ„¢, but if not, file an Issue and I'll take a look.
